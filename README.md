# Machine Activity Application
This proposed capstone project will be named “Machine Activity Application”. It will be a proprietary web application for Northern Quest Resort & Casino which will be used primarily to capture data on the various technical issues encountered using their slot machines. The solutions will be captured as well so that a knowledge base can be created for use in the future when similar issues are encountered. This application will replace the inefficient SharePoint page currently in use. Additionally, this project will add a technical knowledge base and reporting, which is not currently available.

Design, develop and implement an issue and solution tracking application with a technical knowledge base and reporting module. The knowledge base will help capture and retain senior technicians' expertise and know-how for the benefit of all. Also, it will acquire new incidents as they are discovered and catalog them along with their resolution for use in the future.
